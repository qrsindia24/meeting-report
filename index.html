    <h1>Meeting Report</h1>

    <h2>1. Differences Between Wellness Centers, Hospitals, and Clinics</h2>

    <h3>Wellness Centers:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Wellness centers emphasize <strong>preventive care</strong> and holistic health, addressing physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. They offer services like fitness programs, nutrition counseling, and stress management.</li>
        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> They provide a <strong>comprehensive</strong> approach to health, often integrating alternative therapies alongside traditional medical practices. The goal is to empower patients to take charge of their health through education and lifestyle modifications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hospitals:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Hospitals are primarily designed for <strong>acute care</strong>, treating severe illnesses and injuries. They provide emergency services, surgeries, and specialized medical treatments.</li>
        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Hospitals have a structured environment with various departments (e.g., emergency, surgery) that focus on immediate medical needs rather than long-term wellness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Clinics:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Clinics serve as primary care facilities for routine health issues and preventive services. They handle minor injuries, vaccinations, and regular check-ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Clinics typically operate on a smaller scale than hospitals and may specialize in specific areas (e.g., pediatric care, dental services).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Script Improvement</h2>
    <p>To enhance the clarity and effectiveness of scripts used in patient interactions or medical documentation, consider the following strategies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use <strong>clear and concise language</strong> to avoid misunderstandings.</li>
        <li>Avoid jargon unless necessary; if used, ensure it is explained.</li>
        <li>Structure sentences to convey one idea at a time for better readability.</li>
        <li>Implement active voice to make statements more direct and engaging.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Points to Remember and Note</h2>
    <p>When documenting patient interactions or medical records, ensure to include the following critical information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Patient's Name:</strong> Full name for identification.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient's Number:</strong> Unique identifier for tracking records.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient's Problem:</strong> A clear description of the patient's presenting issue or diagnosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient's location:</strong> A clear location from where the patient is from .</li>
